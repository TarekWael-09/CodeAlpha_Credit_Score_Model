📊 Credit Scoring Model using Machine Learning
This project builds a machine learning model to predict whether a customer is likely to default on a loan or repay it on time. It uses historical credit data and multiple ML algorithms for classification.

✅ Key Features:
End-to-end credit scoring pipeline

Data preprocessing: cleaning, encoding, and scaling

Model training using Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and XGBoost

Performance evaluation: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1 Score

Feature importance and model explainability (SHAP or LIME)

Interactive web app using Streamlit to test the model with new inputs

🖥️ Streamlit App:
The project includes a simple Streamlit dashboard where users can:

Input customer details (age, income, employment status, etc.)

Instantly see creditworthiness predictions

View model confidence level and explanations

📁 Dataset:
Trained on a dataset containing customer financial and demographic information such as income, loan amount, credit history, and employment.

⚙️ Tech Stack:
Python

Scikit-learn, XGBoost

Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn

Streamlit for building the web application

SHAP for interpretability
