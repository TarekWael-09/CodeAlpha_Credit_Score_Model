# 💳 Credit Scoring Model using Machine Learning

This project aims to build an intelligent credit scoring system that predicts whether a customer is likely to **repay** a loan or **default**, using historical financial data and machine learning algorithms.

---

## 📌 Overview

Credit scoring helps financial institutions assess the **risk level** of potential borrowers. By training on previous loan applications, this model can identify patterns that differentiate between reliable and risky customers.

## ✅ Features

- 📂 Data Preprocessing: Missing value handling, encoding, scaling
- 🤖 Model Training: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost
- 📈 Evaluation Metrics: Accuracy, Precision, Recall, F1-score
- 🧠 Model Explainability: SHAP (optional)
- 🌐 **Streamlit Web App**: Interactive interface to test new credit applications

---

## 🧪 Dataset

The dataset includes customer information such as:

- Age
- Gender
- Marital status
- Income
- Employment type
- Credit history
- Loan amount
- Previous defaults

> Note: This project uses a sample dataset. You can replace it with your own data.
